## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to utilize Flexbox for layout
design. I also practiced using CSS custom properties and creating responsive,
mobile-first web pages.

Below are some code snippets that showcase what I learned:

```html
<h2 class="name">Dhikrullah Mubarak A.</h2>
```

```css
.social {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
  margin: 15px 0;
  padding: 10px 0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  width: 100%;
  transition: all 0.5s ease;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my skills with responsive
design and CSS animations. I am also looking to deepen my understanding of
JavaScript and React for more dynamic web applications.

### Useful resources

- MDN Web Docs - This is a great resource for understanding the core concepts of
  web development. It provides comprehensive documentation and examples.
- Universe.io - This open-source UI element library was particularly useful for
  finding and using buttons in my project.
